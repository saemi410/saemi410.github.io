Hi, there! :laughing: I am currently a second-year integrated Ph.D. student in the [Computer Science and Engineering department](https://cse.postech.ac.kr) at [Pohang University of Science and Technology](https://www.postech.ac.kr) (POSTECH). I am also a member of the [Machine Learning Lab.](https://ml.postech.ac.kr), where I am supervised by Prof. [Dongwoo Kim](http://dongwookim-ml.github.io). 

My research goal is to make AI safe and robust. In particular, I am currently interested in unlearning and privacy-preserving in generative models, focusing on preventing the generation of specific concepts.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
